## Overview

**SpotifyDL** is a Chrome extension that allows users to download tracks, playlists, or albums directly from Spotify via their browser. The extension supports multiple audio formats and provides integrated decryption and metadata management.

> Built using **Manifest V3**, you can review permissions in the `manifest.json` file.

### Key Features

- **Audio Formats Supported:**
  - **Ogg/Vorbis** (96, 160, 320 Kbits/s) via **PlayPlay CDM** ([source](https://github.com/es3n1n/re-unplayplay))
  - **AAC** (128, 256 Kbits/s) via **Widevine CDM**
- **Integrated Decryption:** Decrypts protected files and adds metadata using **FFmpeg WASM**.
- **Parallel Downloads:** Supports downloading multiple files simultaneously for faster processing.

> **Note:** Widevine decryption requires a valid Widevine device, including an RSA Private Key (PEM or DER format) and a Client ID Blob.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] **PlayPlay** - Migrate decryption from `node-forge` to `WebCrypto` to enhance performance and prevent UI freezing.
- [x] **MP4 AAC** - Add user settings for audio container and codec selection. Users can now choose the audio format when using FFmpeg via the settings interface.
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Improve error logging and implement user-friendly error popups to better inform users of issues.
